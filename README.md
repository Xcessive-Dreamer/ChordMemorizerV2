- PRIORITY: figure out why if the song start with 2 beats per measure it wont change properly
- Add a small UI displaying the chord progression as it goes on and then clears after you reach the end of first chorus.
- Add UI element to show what section of song you are in A section, b section, verse, chorus etc.
